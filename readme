The zip file contains:

  1. A bunch of .F files together with the file
     tslabc which is an ``include file''

  2. To compile them all, run the script componly that
     is in the zip file.

  3. To link, run the script comptsl that is in the zip file.
     This creates an executable called timeslabx

  4. Look at the script called timeslab to see how people on
     our system run timeslab.

Let me know if you have questions (I'm sure I forgot 
something.
